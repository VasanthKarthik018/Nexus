Build a complete Streamlit web application for diagnosing dementia from brain MRI images using a pretrained deep learning model (model.h5), with AI-generated medical reports and Grad-CAM explainability.

🔐 1. Authentication Module

Implement a login page using Streamlit.

Use simple username/password authentication (hardcoded credentials are acceptable).

Use st.session_state to manage login state.

Redirect authenticated users to the dashboard.

🧑‍⚕️ 2. Patient Information Module

Collect patient details:

Patient Name

Age

Gender

Clinical Notes / Symptoms

Validate inputs (mandatory fields, numeric age).

🧠 3. MRI Image Upload & Display

Upload MRI brain scan images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png).

Display the uploaded image clearly in the UI.

⚙️ 4. Image Preprocessing Pipeline

Resize image to 224 × 224

Normalize pixel values to [0,1]

Expand dimensions for model inference

Keep preprocessing modular and reusable

🤖 5. Dementia Classification Model

Load pretrained CNN / VGG / DenseNet model from model.h5

Predict one of the following classes:

NonDemented

VeryMildDemented

MildDemented

ModerateDemented

Display:

Predicted class

Confidence score (%)

Use color-coded alerts:

Green → NonDemented

Orange / Red → Dementia detected

🔍 6. Grad-CAM Visualization (Explainable AI)

Implement Grad-CAM or Grad-CAM++ visualization

Overlay heatmap on original MRI image

Clearly highlight regions contributing to model decision

Display Grad-CAM image alongside prediction results

🧾 7. GenAI-Based Medical Report Generation

Use a Generative AI model (LLM) to generate a clinical-style diagnostic report including:

Patient details summary

Model prediction

Confidence level

Interpretation of Grad-CAM findings

Clinical disclaimer (AI-assisted, not final diagnosis)

Report tone should be professional, medical, and academic

📥 8. Downloadable Reports

Generate and allow download of:

AI Diagnostic Report (PDF / TXT)

Grad-CAM Visualization Report (image embedded in PDF)

Include:

Uploaded MRI image

Grad-CAM heatmap

Prediction results

Generated GenAI explanation

🛠 Technical Requirements

Frontend & backend in Streamlit

Deep learning with TensorFlow / Keras

Image processing using OpenCV, PIL, NumPy

Use reportlab or similar library for PDF generation

Clean, modular, and well-commented code
